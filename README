BanMoron

This is security tool, protects WEB-stie versus attempts of exploit or collect more 
information about WEB-site structure.

Algorithm:

This is binary programs, runs as "Page Not Found" (Err404) CGI handler.
Web-server calls this program, if requested page is not found.
Program analyzes requested URI (env variable REQUEST_URI), and try
to find here some pattern (substring) for activate this or that ban rule.

If no any rule matched, program just prints our regular Page 404 "not Found".
If some substring mathched, program perform action, assigned to this rule.
Currently actions are:
  - just print the page "404 not found" (default)
  - ban by IP (FreeBSD pf)
  - send back zip-bomb
  - send back zip-bomb and ban by IP

Program has modular structure, and this is eady to add other action handlers, or modify rule set.
Currently, program designed very lightweight: Binary code is 6KB only, 
and dependance from libc only. Thus, this is almost no overhead to run this program.

ATTN: binary program is installed with S-bit, to run it as root.
This is needed to run pfctl (or another filter control utilite) to sucessfully
add IP to firewall ban list.

How to use:

1. Open and modify Makefile. Setup correct path CGIPATH to install resulting CGI-program.
2. Edit banmoron.c, and modify rulet accorfing your site needs (lines 37-44).
3. Modify your web-server config, to run this program on event 404. 
   For Apache, specify in the httpd.conf:
	ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/banmoron.cgi"
4. Build program (make) and install it (make install).
5. Restart WEB-server.
