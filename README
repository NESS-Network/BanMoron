BanMoron

This is a security tool, it protects WEB-sites from attempts to exploit or collect more 
information about the WEB-site structure.

Algorithm:

This is a binary program, it runs as "Page Not Found" (Err404) CGI handler.
A Web-server will call this program, if the requested page is not found.
The program analyzes the requested URI (env variable REQUEST_URI), and tries
to find some pattern (substring) to  activate a ban rule.

If no rule is matched, the program just prints out the regular Page 404 "not Found".
If some substring is mathched, the program will perform an action, assigned to a rule.
Currently actions are:
  0 just print the page "404 not found" (default)
  1 ban by IP (FreeBSD pf)
  2 send back zip-bomb
  3 send back zip-bomb and ban by IP

Program has modular structure, and this is easy to add other action handlers to it, or modify the rule set.
Currently, the program is designed to be very lightweight: Binary code is 6KB only, 
and dependance from libc only. Thus, there is almost no overhead to run this program.

ATTN: binary program is installed with S-bit, to run it as owner (root).
This is needed to run pfctl (or another filter control utilite) to sucessfully
add IP to firewall ban list.

How to use:

1. Open and modify Makefile. Setup correct path CGIPATH to install resulting CGI-program.
   In addition, maybe you need to modify OWNER/GROUP for install.
2. Edit banmoron.c, and modify rules according to your site's needs (lines 37-45).
3. Modify your web-server config, to run this program on event 404. 
   For Apache, specify in the httpd.conf:
	ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/banmoron.cgi"
4. Build the program (make) and install it (make install).
5. Add into your firewall table <morons> and apropriate rules to ban IPs from this table.
   See example in pf.conf
6. Add into crontab rule to remove banned IPs after some timeout.
   Example pf.crontab contains a command to unblock IPs after 3days of inactivity.
7. Restart WEB-server.
